### Branches

The [master] branch should only contain working versions of the web app, therefore it should be thoroughly tested before being merged into that branch.

[development] contains the current working version, and can suffer breaking changes during development. Merges in to this branch still requires code reviews from  at least one other team member, to avoid unnecessary breaking changes.
